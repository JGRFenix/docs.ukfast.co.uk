Threat Scan
##############################

Threat Scan is our base tier, providing a robust, clear and concise vulnerability scanning platform that can be used to hunt down security holes in your environment via external vulnerability scans. Threat Scan allows for unlimited scans to be ran either on demand or on a schedule, allowing around the clock scanning.

Each completed scan is compiled into a clear vulnerability report available via MyUKFast, detailing any detected vulnerabilities, severity scores, vulnerability information and remediation advice allowing you to quickly patch and secure your environment. Scan reports can also be exported as a PDF for offline review.

More information on Threat Scan can be found on our :doc:`/security/threatvision/threatscan/index` documentation: 



Threat Surveillance
##############################

Adding endpoint monitoring and log analysis, Threat Surveillance expands your security solution providing real-time threat detection and alerting via a lightweight software agent(s) installed onto your various endpoints. Through event correlation and analysis, Threat Surveillance can detect when a cyber attack is in progress and trigger automated defences to block the attack. Furthermore, email alerts can be generated when a cyber attack is underway, allowing for real-time insight into your environment's defences.

Protecting your codebase and core system files, Threat Surveillance also provides real-time File Integrity Monitoring that will trigger an alert whenever a monitored file/directory (Requires configuration) is changed, added or deleted. FIM helps to reduce the risk of any unwanted file changes going undetected.

Through an easy to use dashboard and control panel, all data collected through Threat Surveillance is visualised in MyUKFast, along with any further information on any generated alerts.

More information on Threat Surveillance can be found on our :doc:`/security/threatvision/threatsurveillance/index` documentation.
