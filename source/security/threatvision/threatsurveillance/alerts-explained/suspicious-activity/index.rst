=====================================
Suspicious Activity
=====================================

If an attack was successfuly, it's common for an attacer to use the system for malicous purposes. This oftern generates suspicious activity that may indicate that a security breahc has accured.

On the other hand, some attack/exploit methods may generate suspicious events or logs that can be used to determine when an attack is in progress.

Foe example, our rule for 'Attacks followed by the addition of a user' is of particular note. It's common for attackers to create themselves a user on a system to allow them to gain acess back into the system without needed to exploit again. 

The 'Documentation Search' bar towards the top of all pages is a useful tool, simply search for the alert's rule description or ID to find relevant pages.
