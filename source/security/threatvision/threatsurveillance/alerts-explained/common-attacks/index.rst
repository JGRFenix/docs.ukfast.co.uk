Common attacks
=====================================

Some attack types are far more common that others. They may target a range of different service types using different variations of of an attack, ultimatly to achive the same goal.

One very common attack type is a 'brute force' attack. Brute force attacks, as the name suggests, tries to force their way into a service by trying many different usernames and passwords as fast as they can. Many attackers will have a list of default or common passwords used for a specific service type, such as 'admin' 'admin', 'root' 'toor' or 'admin' 'wordpress'.
