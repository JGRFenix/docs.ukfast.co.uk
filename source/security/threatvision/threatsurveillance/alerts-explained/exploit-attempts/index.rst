=====================================
Exploit attempts
=====================================

An exploit attempt rule relates to any activity that has been linked to an attempt to exploit a known vulnerability. The types of exploit differ greatly but share the same goal of exploiting a vulnerability to potentially harm/control the target system.

For example exploit is the famous shellshock attack. Shellshock could enable an attacker to cause Bash to execute arbitrary commands and gain unauthorized access to many Internet-facing services, such as web servers, that use Bash to process requests. .. _Refernece: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_\(software_bug\)
