Threat Surveillance Alerts Explained
=====================================

Understanding Threat Surveillance alerts is key to ensuring that your server is secure and protected from attacks. Should you receive a Threat Surveillance alert, you can use the below pages to find more information regarding what the alert means, what service it relates to and the type of attack that could potentially be in progress.

Our alerts are split into a number of groups/categories. The main categories are:

* File Integrity Monitoring
* Brute force
* Expoit attempts
* Malware
* Scanning and reconnisance
* Suspicious activity
* System activity

The 'Documentation Search' bar towards the top of all pages is a useful tool, simply search for the alert's rule description or ID to find relevant pages.

Alternatively, a full document tree is shown below.
