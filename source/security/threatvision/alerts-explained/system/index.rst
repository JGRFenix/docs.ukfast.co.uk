System
=====================================

In addition to monitoring for suspicious activity and threats, UKFast Threat Surveillance can also alert for system-level issues. Alerts can be generated for high memory usage, killed processes, disks errors and system auditing tools such as 'auditd'. 

This information can prove useful when diagnosing issues with the system and when investigating suspicious activity that could be the result fo a compromise elsewhere in the system.
