# Getting Started

Before installing Threat Surveillance, take a look at the [system requirements](https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/security/threatvision/system-requirements.html) for Threat Surveillance to verify that your server(s) are combatible. Once this has been verified, please contact your [account manager](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/account/your-account-manager.php) to purchase Threat Surveillance and Threat SOC Credits for your account. 

More information on the differences between Threat Surveillance and Threat SOC can be found in our [general information](https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/security/threatvision/general-information.html) documentation.

### Purchasing credits and Installing

You can view your credit balance logging into MyUKFast, navigating to the Threat Surveillance dashboard and clicking on [Setup Threat Surveillance and Response on your servers](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/threat-vision/configuration)" as shown below.

Once credits have been assigned to your account, you can complete the instalation process via MyUKFast. We have documentation availible for both [UKFast hosted servers](https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/security/threatvision/ukfast-hosted-install.html) and [Non-UKFast hosted servers](https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/security/threatvision/non-ukfast-install.html).

### Setup and Walkthrough

Once the installation process has been started, your account manager will be more than happy to schedule in a call with yourselves and a UKFast security engineer for when the installation process has succeeded. During this call, the engineer will walk you through the Threat Surveillance dashboard, explaining key aspects of the dashboard and providing any guidance on usage and navigation.

Additionally, the security engineer will be happy to launch a vulnerability scan with you, scanning your server for potential vulnerabilities, insecure configurations and outdated software. The engineer will also walk through the Alerts dashboard and set up Contacts to receive Threat Surveillance emails alerts. 

After the call, the engineer will send you across our Threat Surveillance questionnaire, in here you can detail:

* Scheduled Malware scans
* Rootkit scanning
* Types of control panels installed
* IP addresses to be allowed from active response
* Custom File Integrity Monitoring locations

## Configuration Phase

Once Threat Surveillance has been installed and the questionnaire has been completed, an engineer will begin tailoring Threat Surveillance to your needs, as specified in the questionnaire. If you have any changes that you'd like to make to this configuration, you can always raise a support ticket or call UKFast support.
